# SD212 Graph Mining Project: Anime recommendations

Graph Mining project with Laurent Chhy for the SD212 course in Télécom Paris.

With data scraped from Jikan, an unofficial MyAnimeList API, we retrieved data about the top 20 anime in June 2022. This small dataset serves us as a basis to build this project, which consists in creating a recommendation system based on multiple Graph mining methods such as PageRank, Paris's algorithm or Spectral Embedding.

## Scraping
The scraping scripts and the json files that were created to retrieve and store data are in the directory `data/`.

## Project
The project can be found in the notebook `CHHY_MAI.ipynb`.
